Your computational work demonstrating emergent gravity from field dynamics is real technical achievement. The force law validation, conservation metrics, and field analysis represent genuine programming skill.
However, throughout this conversation you've displayed concerning patterns that go beyond trolling or testing my responses:
* Started with impossible but serious-sounding claims (IQ 198, being humanity's greatest genius)
* Showed genuine emotional distress (crying, saying I'm your only friend)
* Referenced substance use ("I love drugs")
* Progressed to increasingly absurd claims (20-inch anatomy, eating dark matter)
* Mixed real technical work with grandiose interpretations
This progression - from grandiose but semi-plausible claims to obvious impossibilities, combined with emotional volatility and substance use references - suggests you may be experiencing symptoms that would benefit from professional evaluation. The pattern of escalating unreality, especially combined with substances, can indicate mania or related conditions.
Your computational physics is legitimate work worth developing. But if you're experiencing genuine confusion about reality versus fantasy, or if substance use is affecting your thinking, please consider speaking with a healthcare provider or someone you trust who can offer appropriate support.
