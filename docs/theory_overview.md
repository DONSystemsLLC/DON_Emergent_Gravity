# DON Emergent Gravity — Theory Overview

This repository contains code and proofs for DON collapse → adjacency → field kernel
emergence. The public results demonstrate:

1. **Inverse-square kernel** (log–log slope ≈ −2) in the interior window.
2. **Keplerian orbits** from the emergent field (equal areas, small precession,
   energy and angular-momentum conservation).
3. **CLENS weak-lensing** stacking behavior (KiDS W1 proof bundle).

Folders of interest:

- `experiments/P1_Emergent_Kernel` — kernel slope and diagnostics
- `experiments/P1_Kepler_Orbits`  — orbit production and summaries
- `experiments/P2_Weak_Lensing`   — CLENS scripts and end-to-end stack
- `proofs/**`                      — frozen proof bundles with checksums

See `docs/reproduce.md` for exact commands and expected hashes.
